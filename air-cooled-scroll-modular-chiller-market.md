<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air-Cooled Scroll Modular Chiller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooling Only Type</li><li>Heat Pump Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The air-cooled scroll modular chiller market consists of two main types: cooling only type and heat pump type. Cooling only type refers to chillers that are solely designed to cool a space by removing heat from the air or water. On the other hand, heat pump type chillers do both cooling and heating. They extract heat from one area and transfer it to another, allowing them to provide both cooling and heating solutions. These two market types cater to different needs in terms of temperature control.</p></p>
