<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The New Energy Vehicle Tyre Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyre</li><li>Bias Tyre</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The New Energy Vehicle Tyre market consists of two types: radial tyre and bias tyre. Radial tyres are designed with layers of steel cords entwined radially under the tyre tread, providing better flexibility and ensuring a smoother ride. These tyres offer enhanced stability, longer tread life, and improved fuel efficiency. Conversely, bias tyres have layers of fabric cords overlapping in a crisscross pattern, which make them more durable and suitable for off-road or heavy-duty applications. Both tyre types cater to different driving needs, with radial tyres focusing on comfort and performance, while bias tyres prioritize strength and durability.</p></p>
