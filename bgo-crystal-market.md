<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The BGO Crystal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Czochralski Method</li><li>Bridgman Method</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The BGO crystal market consists of crystals produced using two methods: Czochralski and Bridgman. The Czochralski method involves melting the raw materials in a crucible and slowly pulling a seed crystal out of the liquid, allowing it to grow into a larger crystal. This method yields high-quality, defect-free crystals suitable for radiation detectors. On the other hand, the Bridgman method involves the raw materials being melted and slowly cooled in a specially designed furnace, resulting in crystals with controlled defects, making them ideal for scintillation detectors. Both methods cater to specific applications within the BGO crystal market.</p></p>
