<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vulnerability Management Tools Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cloud-based</li><li>On Premises</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Vulnerability management tools help organizations identify and address security vulnerabilities in their networks and systems. The market is divided into two main types: cloud-based and on-premises. Cloud-based solutions are hosted on remote servers and accessed through the internet, offering scalability, flexibility, and ease of use. On-premises solutions, on the other hand, are installed and operated within an organization's own infrastructure, providing greater control and customization but requiring more resources for maintenance and management. Both types aim to detect, assess, and manage vulnerabilities to protect against potential cyber threats.</p></p>
