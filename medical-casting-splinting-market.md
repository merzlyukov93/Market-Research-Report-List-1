<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Medical casting and splinting are non-invasive techniques used in orthopedic care to immobilize and support fractures, dislocations, and sprains. Casting involves applying a hard, rigid material, such as plaster or fiberglass, around the affected area to stabilize the bone and promote healing. On the other hand, splinting uses a softer material, such as padded boards or pre-made splints, to provide temporary support and allow for swelling reduction. Both casting and splinting serve to reduce pain, maintain alignment, and aid in the recovery process for patients with musculoskeletal injuries.</p></p>
