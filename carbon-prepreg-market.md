<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Prepreg Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoset</li><li>Thermoplastic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Carbon Prepreg market consists of two main types: Thermoset and Thermoplastic. Thermoset prepreg is a type that undergoes a curing process when heated, resulting in a hardened structure with excellent chemical resistance and high-temperature stability. On the other hand, Thermoplastic prepreg can be melted and reformed multiple times without losing its original properties, making it more flexible and easier to process. Both types have unique characteristics and applications in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and sporting goods, contributing to the growth of the overall Carbon Prepreg market.</p></p>
