<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dissolved Airfloatation Unit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Tank</li><li>Plate Pack</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) unit is a water treatment system used to separate suspended solids from a liquid. There are two main types of DAF units: open tank and plate pack. In an open tank DAF unit, the contaminated water is introduced into a large tank where air is dissolved under pressure, causing suspended particles to float to the surface and form a layer of sludge. In a plate pack DAF unit, the water flows through a series of inclined plates that facilitate the separation process, allowing the particles to settle at the bottom for removal.</p></p>
