<p><h1>Pitch Coke Market, Centers on Aspects such as Market Growth Market Share, Market Opportunity, and Projected Forecasts Spanning from 2023 to 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Pitch coke is a byproduct of coal tar or petroleum refining, which is obtained when the distillation process of these substances produces coal tar pitch. It is a solid material that has a low volatile content and high carbon content, making it suitable for various applications such as electrode production, carbon paste production, and carbon black production.</p><p>The future outlook of the pitch coke market is expected to be moderate due to various factors influencing its growth. Firstly, the increasing demand for pitch coke in the aluminum and steel industries is expected to drive market growth. Pitch coke is widely used as a conductive material in the production of electrodes for aluminum smelting, and its high carbon content makes it suitable for steel production. The growing infrastructure and construction sector is also expected to contribute to market growth as they are major consumers of steel.</p><p>However, the pitch coke market is restraining due to the emergence of alternative materials and stringent regulations on carbon emissions. The development and adoption of advanced technologies, such as electric arc furnaces, for steel production reduce the need for pitch coke as a carbon source. Additionally, the focus on reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to cleaner energy sources is expected to impact the demand for pitch coke in the long run.</p><p>In conclusion, the pitch coke market is expected to grow at a negative compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of -2.40% during the forecasted period. Factors such as increasing demand from the aluminum and steel industries can drive market growth. However, the emergence of alternative materials and environmental regulations may hinder its growth potential.</p></p>
