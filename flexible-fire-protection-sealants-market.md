<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Fire Protection Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastometric Type</li><li>Intumescent Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Flexible Fire Protection Sealants Market comprises two main types: Elastomeric Type and Intumescent Type. Elastomeric sealants are made from rubber-like materials, offering flexibility and elasticity to accommodate joint movements. They provide fire protection by forming a stable barrier against heat and flames. Intumescent sealants, on the other hand, expand when exposed to heat, forming a thick layer of insulating foam. This expanded layer acts as a fire-resistant barrier, preventing the spread of flames and heat. Both types of sealants play a crucial role in fire prevention and protection in various applications.</p></p>
