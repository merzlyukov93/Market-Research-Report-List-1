<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single Mechanical Seals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pusher Type Seal</li><li>Non-pusher Seal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single mechanical seals are used in various industries to prevent leakage in rotating equipment. There are two types - pusher type seals and non-pusher seals. Pusher type seals utilize springs to maintain contact with the rotating shaft, creating a seal. They are commonly used in applications with high shaft speeds or pressure. Non-pusher seals, on the other hand, do not use springs and rely on the pressure from the sealed fluid to ensure contact. These are generally used in applications with lower speeds or pressures.</p></p>
