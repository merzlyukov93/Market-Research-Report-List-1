<p><strong>The Autonomous Car Technology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS)</li><li>semi-autonomous car technology</li><li>fully-autonomous car technology</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Autonomous car technology refers to the ability of a vehicle to operate itself without human intervention. The market for autonomous car technology can be categorized into three types: Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), semi-autonomous car technology, and fully-autonomous car technology. ADAS includes features like lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control, and automatic emergency braking, aiming to assist the driver but still requires their attention. Semi-autonomous car technology can handle certain driving tasks independently, but the driver must remain alert and ready to take control. Fully-autonomous car technology, on the other hand, can operate without human intervention, allowing passengers to engage in other activities while the vehicle handles all driving tasks.</p></p>
