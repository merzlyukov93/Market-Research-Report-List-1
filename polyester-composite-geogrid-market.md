<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Composite Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension</li><li>Uniaxial Tension</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The polyester composite geogrid market consists of two main types: biaxial tension and uniaxial tension. Biaxial tension geogrids are designed to bear loads in two perpendicular directions, offering strength and stability in both dimensions. They are commonly used in applications like soil stabilization and road construction. On the other hand, uniaxial tension geogrids are designed to bear loads in a single direction, providing enhanced strength and reinforcement for structures like retaining walls and embankments. These geogrids offer specific benefits depending on the direction of load and the nature of the project.</p></p>
