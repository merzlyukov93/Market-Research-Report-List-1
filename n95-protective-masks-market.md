<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The N95 Protective Masks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mask with Exhalation Valve</li><li>Mask without Exhalation Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The N95 Protective Masks Market consists of two main types: masks with an exhalation valve and masks without an exhalation valve. Masks with an exhalation valve have a one-way valve that allows easier breathing and reduces heat buildup inside the mask, making them more comfortable to wear. However, they may not provide as much protection to others, as the valve allows unfiltered air to be exhaled. On the other hand, masks without an exhalation valve provide full filtration in both directions, protecting both the wearer and those around them.</p></p>
