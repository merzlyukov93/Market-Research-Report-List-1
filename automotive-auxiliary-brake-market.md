<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Auxiliary Brake Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>DrumBrake</li><li>DiscBrake</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The automotive auxiliary brake market consists of two main types: drum brake and disc brake. Drum brakes are designed with a round drum-shaped component that houses brake shoes, which press against its inner surface to create friction and slow down the vehicle. On the other hand, disc brakes use a set of flat discs that are clamped together by brake pads to produce friction and decelerate the vehicle. Both types of brakes are commonly used in automobiles, with their effectiveness and performance varying depending on the specific design and application.</p></p>
