<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spare Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inner Tube</li><li>Tubeless</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The spare tire market can be broadly classified into two types: inner tube and tubeless. Inner tube spare tires require a rubber tube inside the tire to hold the air, whereas tubeless spare tires are designed to hold the air directly within the tire. Both types have their pros and cons. Inner tube spare tires are generally cheaper and easier to repair, but they require extra maintenance. Tubeless spare tires, on the other hand, are more resistant to punctures and offer a smoother ride but are slightly more expensive.</p></p>
