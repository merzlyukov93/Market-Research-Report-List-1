<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Run-Out Gauge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Run-Out</li><li>Axial Run-Out</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Run-Out Gauge market consists of two main types: radial run-out and axial run-out. Radial run-out gauges are used to measure the amount of variation in distance between a rotating object and its center. They determine if there is any deviation from a perfect circle. On the other hand, axial run-out gauges measure the amount of variation in distance between a rotating object and a fixed reference point. They assess if the rotation is aligned properly. Both types play important roles in industries that require precise measurements, such as manufacturing and engineering.</p></p>
