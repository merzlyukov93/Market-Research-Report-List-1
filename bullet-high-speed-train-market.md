<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bullet High-Speed Train Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wheel on Rail</li><li>Maglev</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Bullet High-Speed Train market consists of two main types: Wheel on Rail and Maglev. Wheel on Rail technology uses wheels that run along a track to provide stability and guidance to the train. It is the most common and widely adopted technology globally. On the other hand, Maglev trains employ magnetic levitation to eliminate the need for wheels and track, resulting in even higher speeds and reduced friction. Although Maglev systems are technologically advanced, they are less prevalent due to higher costs and limited infrastructure.</p></p>
