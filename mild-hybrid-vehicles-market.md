<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mild-Hybrid Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SHEV</li><li>PHEV</li><li>PSHEV</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mild-hybrid vehicles refer to cars that combine an internal combustion engine with a small electric motor to enhance fuel efficiency. There are three main types of mild-hybrid vehicles: Start/Stop Hybrid Electric Vehicles (SHEV), Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV), and Power-assist Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PSHEV). SHEVs use electric motors to temporarily stop the engine when idle, minimizing fuel consumption. PHEVs have larger battery packs that can be charged directly from an external power source, providing electric-only range. PSHEVs use electric motors for additional power to boost the engine's performance, improving fuel efficiency and power output.</p></p>
