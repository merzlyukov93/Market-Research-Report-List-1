<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Circuit Breakers & Fuses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Circuit Breakers</li><li>Fuses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The circuit breakers and fuses market consists of two main types of protective devices for electrical systems. Circuit breakers are automatic switches that can detect and interrupt abnormal electrical currents to prevent damage, such as overheating or fire. They can be reset after being tripped. On the other hand, fuses are disposable devices that contain a wire that melts and breaks the circuit when excessive current flows through them. Once a fuse breaks, it needs to be replaced. Both circuit breakers and fuses play a crucial role in maintaining the safety and stability of electrical systems.</p></p>
