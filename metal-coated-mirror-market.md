<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal-Coated Mirror Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>First Surface Mirror</li><li>Second Surface Mirror</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal-coated mirror market consists of two main types, namely first surface mirror and second surface mirror. First surface mirrors have the reflective layer on the front surface, allowing maximum light to pass through without any distortion or double images. On the other hand, second surface mirrors have the reflective layer on the back surface, protected by a transparent coating. This type reduces the risk of damage to the reflective layer and provides a more accurate reflection, making it suitable for applications like telescopes and rear-view mirrors.</p></p>
