<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Color Filter Photoresists Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Negative Photoresists</li><li>Positive Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The color filter photoresists market comprises two main types: negative photoresists and positive photoresists. Negative photoresists are light-sensitive materials that become less soluble when exposed to light, making the areas exposed to light remain after development. Positive photoresists, on the other hand, become more soluble when exposed to light, resulting in the removal of the areas exposed to light during development. Both types are crucial in the production of color filters, a key component in displays, to create patterns that allow specific colors to pass through, effectively enhancing image quality.</p></p>
