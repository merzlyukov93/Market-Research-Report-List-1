<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passive Fire Retardant Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>By Type</li><li>Intumescent</li><li>Cementitious</li><li>By Technology</li><li>Water-based Coating</li><li>Solvent-based Coating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Passive fire retardant coatings are utilized to prevent the rapid spread of fire and provide protection to various structures. There are two main types of these coatings. Intumescent coatings expand when exposed to high temperatures, forming an insulating char layer that slows down the heat transfer. Cementitious coatings, on the other hand, provide fire resistance through their insulating properties. These coatings can be further classified into water-based or solvent-based coatings based on the technology used to apply them. Water-based coatings are eco-friendly, while solvent-based coatings offer better durability.</p></p>
