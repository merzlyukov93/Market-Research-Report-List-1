<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lithium Triborate (LBO) Crystal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Coated</li><li>Uncoated</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Lithium Triborate (LBO) Crystal market is divided into two types: coated and uncoated. Coated LBO crystals are those that have a thin layer of coating applied to their surface. This coating enhances the crystal's performance, improves its durability, and provides protection against environmental factors. On the other hand, uncoated LBO crystals do not have any additional coatings and are in their original state. These uncoated crystals are ideal for applications where the coating is not necessary or desired. The choice between coated and uncoated LBO crystals depends on the specific application requirements and preferences of the customer.</p></p>
