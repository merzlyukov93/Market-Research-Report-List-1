<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Propanol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>N-Propanol</li><li>Isopropanol</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Propanol is a type of alcohol that exists in two different forms: N-Propanol and Isopropanol. N-Propanol, also known as 1-Propanol, is produced by the hydrogenation of propionaldehyde. It is mainly used as a solvent in the production of coatings, adhesives, and printing inks. On the other hand, Isopropanol, also known as 2-Propanol or rubbing alcohol, is synthesized by the direct hydration of propene. It finds extensive applications as a disinfectant, cleaning agent, and solvent in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and household products. Both forms of propanol serve various industrial purposes but have distinct characteristics and uses.</p></p>
