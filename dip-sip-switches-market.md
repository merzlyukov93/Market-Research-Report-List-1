<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DIP & SIP Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SMT Type</li><li>Through Hole Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DIP and SIP switches are used to control electronic devices by toggling between different settings. The market for these switches can be classified into two types: SMT (Surface Mount Technology) type and Through Hole type. SMT type switches are compact, lightweight, and designed to be mounted directly onto the surface of a circuit board. They are widely used in modern electronic devices due to their smaller size and compatibility with automated assembly processes. Through Hole type switches, on the other hand, are larger and require holes to be drilled in the circuit board for installation. They are commonly found in older electronic equipment or devices that require durability and stability.</p></p>
