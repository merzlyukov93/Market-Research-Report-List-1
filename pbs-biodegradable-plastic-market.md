<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PBS Biodegradable Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Complete Degradation</li><li>Partial Degradation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PBS biodegradable plastic market can be divided into two types: complete degradation and partial degradation. Complete degradation refers to plastics that can fully break down into natural components, such as water and carbon dioxide, within a specific timeframe. Partial degradation, on the other hand, involves plastics that only break down to a certain extent, leaving behind some residue or microplastics. Both types aim to contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing plastic waste, but complete degradation offers a more comprehensive solution by leaving no persistent pollutants behind.</p></p>
