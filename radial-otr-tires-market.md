<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radial OTR Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inner Tube</li><li>Tubeless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial OTR Tires, commonly used in off-road vehicles and heavy equipment, come in two market types: Inner Tube and Tubeless. Inner Tube tires have an additional layer inside that holds air, preventing air leakage. They require a separate inner tube to be inserted during installation. On the other hand, Tubeless tires are airtight and have a built-in seal, eliminating the need for an inner tube. They are commonly used in modern vehicles and offer advantages like reduced maintenance and better puncture resistance.</p></p>
